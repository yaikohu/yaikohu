ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @yaikohu

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in front-end development but also in everything else...

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working doing an internship at [PTTRNS.ai](https://www.pttrns.ai).

ğŸ“« You can contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-beem-3a245a117/)!

My main account is @[yaikohi](https://github.com/yaikohi) with an 'i' at the end instead of an 'u'.
